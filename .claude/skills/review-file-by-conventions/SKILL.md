description: "Review a file for convention violations. Supports lab/tasks/ files (conceptual + convention review), wiki/ files, contributing/conventions/ files, and instructors/meetings/ meeting-report.md files (cross-checked against the transcript and files discussed). Writes the review report to instructors/file-reviews/."

Review a single file for problems — first conceptual and pedagogical issues (for task files) or transcript cross-check (for meeting reports), then convention violations. Accepted locations: `lab/tasks/`, `wiki/`, `contributing/conventions/`, and `instructors/meetings/` (meeting-report.md files only).

## Steps

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to get the file path. Accept:
   - Paths under `lab/tasks/` (e.g., `lab/tasks/setup.md`, `lab/tasks/required/task-2.md`)
   - Paths under `wiki/` (e.g., `wiki/web-development.md`)
   - Paths under `contributing/conventions/` (e.g., `contributing/conventions/writing/common.md`)
   - Meeting report files matching the pattern `instructors/meetings/week-N/meeting-M/meeting-report.md` (e.g., `instructors/meetings/week-2/meeting-1/meeting-report.md`)
   If the path is missing or does not match one of these patterns, ask the user.
2. Read the target file.
3. Read the convention files that apply to the target file:
   - **For `lab/tasks/` files:**
     - [`contributing/conventions/writing/tasks.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/writing/tasks.md) — Section 13 defines the ten review dimensions (D1–D10) for conceptual review; Section 3 and Section 12 define task structure and design principles for convention review
     - [`contributing/conventions/writing/common.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/writing/common.md) — writing conventions (4.1–4.23)
   - **For `wiki/` files:**
     - [`contributing/conventions/writing/common.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/writing/common.md) — writing conventions (4.1–4.23)
     - [`contributing/conventions/writing/wiki.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/writing/wiki.md) — wiki file structure and section patterns
   - **For `contributing/conventions/` files:**
     - [`contributing/conventions/conventions.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/conventions.md) — conventions for writing conventions
   - **For `instructors/meetings/` meeting-report.md files:**
     - [`contributing/conventions/meeting-report.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/meeting-report.md) — meeting report format rules (Sections 3–4) and the five review categories (Section 5)
4. (**For `instructors/meetings/` files only**) Derive the transcript path by replacing `meeting-report.md` with `transcripts/transcript-by-speaker.txt` in the report path (e.g., `instructors/meetings/week-2/meeting-1/transcripts/transcript-by-speaker.txt`). Read the transcript. If the report's **Metadata → Files discussed** section lists any files, read each of them.
5. **Conceptual review** (only for `lab/tasks/` files): Analyse the file against each dimension (D1–D10) from Section 13 of [`contributing/conventions/writing/tasks.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/writing/tasks.md). For each problem found, record: the dimension, the line number(s) or section, a short description, severity (`[High]`, `[Medium]`, or `[Low]`), and a suggested fix.
6. **Meeting report review** (only for `instructors/meetings/` files): Analyse the report against the five categories in Section 5 of [`contributing/conventions/meeting-report.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/meeting-report.md). For each finding, cite the relevant transcript line or report line number:
   - **5.1. Transcript coverage** — Go through the transcript line by line. Flag each substantive point, decision, question, disagreement, example, or topic that is missing or under-represented in the report.
   - **5.2. Accuracy** — Flag each claim in the report that contradicts the transcript (wrong speaker attribution, incorrect timestamp, misquote, decision recorded as unanimous when there was dissent, etc.).
   - **5.3. Files discussed** — For each file listed under Metadata → Files discussed, verify that the report's references to that file's content are consistent with the actual file. Flag every mismatch. Skip if no files are listed.
   - **5.4. Format compliance** — Check the report against Sections 3 (General rules) and 4 (Sections) of the conventions. Flag violations: missing sections, items written as bullet lists instead of subsections, bold labels used instead of headings, PII leaks, missing cross-references, etc.
   - **5.5. Internal consistency** — Flag contradictions within the report itself: a decision conflicting with an open question, an action point referencing a non-existent decision, broken anchor links, duplicate numbering, etc.
7. **Convention review** (for `lab/tasks/`, `wiki/`, and `contributing/conventions/` files only): Go through the target file **line by line**. Check it against **every** convention in the applicable convention files. Flag each violation with its line number.
8. Scan for `<!-- TODO ... -->` comments. Report each one with its line number and the comment text.
9. Scan for empty sections: a heading immediately followed by another heading, a `<!-- TODO ... -->` comment, or end of file, with no real content lines in between. Report each empty section with its line number and heading text.

## Rules

- The convention files are the single source of truth. Check every rule they contain — do not skip any.
- Do not invent rules beyond what the convention files state.
- Be strict: flag every violation, no matter how small.
- Do not fix anything — only report.
- If a convention does not apply to the file (e.g., the file has no Docker commands), skip that category and note "Not applicable."
- For `lab/tasks/setup.md`: skip task-only conventions (Section 3 template, acceptance criteria format). Apply all `common.md` conventions.
- For `contributing/conventions/conventions.md` itself: apply its own rules — the file is self-referential and must comply with the conventions it defines.

## Output format

Write the report to `instructors/file-reviews/<repo-root-path>`, where `<repo-root-path>` is the file's path from the repository root (e.g., `instructors/file-reviews/lab/tasks/setup.md` for `lab/tasks/setup.md`, `instructors/file-reviews/instructors/meetings/week-2/meeting-1/meeting-report.md` for `instructors/meetings/week-2/meeting-1/meeting-report.md`). Create intermediate directories if they do not exist.

The report must be self-contained so another session or agent can act on it without extra context. Structure:

1. **Header** — file path reviewed, date, convention files used, transcript path (for meeting reports only).
2. **Conceptual findings** (only for `lab/tasks/` files) — grouped by dimension (D1–D10). Under each dimension, list findings as numbered items with severity, line number(s) or section, description, and suggested fix. If a dimension has no findings, write "No issues found."
3. **Meeting report findings** (only for `instructors/meetings/` files) — grouped by review category (5.1 Transcript coverage, 5.2 Accuracy, 5.3 Files discussed, 5.4 Format compliance, 5.5 Internal consistency). Under each category, list findings as numbered items with the relevant transcript or report line number, description, and suggested fix. If a category has no findings, write "No issues found."
4. **Convention findings** (for `lab/tasks/`, `wiki/`, and `contributing/conventions/` files only) — grouped by convention number (e.g., "4.2. Terminal commands", "Section 3. Task document structure"). Under each group, list findings as numbered items with line numbers. If a group has no findings, write "No issues found."
5. **TODOs** — list every `<!-- TODO ... -->` comment with its line number and text. If none, write "No TODOs found."
6. **Empty sections** — list every heading that has no content (only a TODO comment, another heading, or EOF follows). Include line number and heading text. If none, write "No empty sections found."
7. **Summary** — total finding count and a short overall assessment.

After writing the file, print its path in the conversation so the user can find it.
